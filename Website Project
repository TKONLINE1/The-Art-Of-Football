              The game of football or soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. With origins that date back many centuries, soccer is played by young children, college students and professional. Football is played on a large grass field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to get the soccer ball into the opposing team's goal. The key to soccer is that, with the exception of the goalie, players cannot touch the ball with their hands, they can only kick, knee, or head the ball to advance it or score a goal.
